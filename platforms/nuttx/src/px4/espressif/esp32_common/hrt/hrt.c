/**
 * @file drv_hrt.c
 *
 * High-resolution timer callouts and timekeeping.
 *
 * This can use any general or advanced STM32 timer.
 *
 * Note that really, this could use systick too, but that's
 * monopolised by NuttX and stealing it would just be awkward.
 *
 * We don't use the NuttX STM32 driver per se; rather, we
 * claim the timer and then drive it directly.
